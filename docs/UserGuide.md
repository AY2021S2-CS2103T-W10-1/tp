## Features

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [tag/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe tag/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[tag/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `tag/friend`, `tag/friend tag/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

Format: `find PREFIX/KEYWORD` where PREFIX is one of the following: `n`, `a`, `p`, `tag`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`
* Only **one type of prefix** can be specified
* Keywords separated by space will require both keywords to be matched.
  e.g. `Hans Yang` will only return `Hans Gruber Yang` instead of `Bo Yang`
* Prefixes for searching name `n/`, address `a/`, tag `tag/`, phone number `p/`

**Examples:**
* `find n/John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
